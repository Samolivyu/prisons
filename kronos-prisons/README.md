# Prison Management System

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a comprehensive Prison Management System (PMS), developed using Vue for the front end, HTML and CSS for the user interface, and Laravel for the backend. The system aims to streamline prison operations, offering features such as a Prison Log, Dashboard, and APIs for efficient management and communication within the prison environment.

## Market Research and Value Addition

To ensure that the Prison Management System fulfills the target users' needs, a thorough market research initiative was undertaken. The identified needs and pain points of prison management were used as a basis for ideating on valuable additions to the system. The aim is to provide an efficient, secure, and user-friendly platform that addresses the challenges faced by prison officials and staff.
